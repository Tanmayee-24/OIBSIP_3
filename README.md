LEVEL 2 TASK 3 - A TO DO LIST APP
A BASIC TO-DO WEBAPP
Develop a basic to-do app that enables a user to add daily tasks.

The to-do web app must allow users to add new items to a list, and items added to a list must be visible. Also, a user can mark a task “complete” upon its successful completion, and these completed tasks must appear on a separate list, say Completed Tasks.

You can also add a separate section titled Pending Tasks that will list all the tasks that require completion. In such a case, the to-do list will be a union of the Pending Tasks list and the Completed Tasks list. Irrespective of the list, a user must be able to delete or edit tasks from it.

To further increase the web app's complexity or make it more detailed, you can add the date and time when a task is added and/or completed

Explanation of the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in designing the To-Do List web app:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML provides the structure and content of the To-Do List web app. It defines the layout of elements such as input fields, buttons, and lists. HTML organizes these elements in a hierarchical structure, ensuring that users can interact with them easily and effectively.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is responsible for the visual styling and presentation of the To-Do List web app. It allows for customization of the app's appearance, including colors, fonts, spacing, and overall design aesthetics. CSS ensures that the app is visually appealing and user-friendly, enhancing the user experience.

JavaScript: JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality to the To-Do List web app. It enables dynamic behavior such as adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, deleting tasks, and updating the user interface accordingly. JavaScript also allows for the implementation of features like sorting tasks, filtering tasks, and storing tasks locally or on a server. Overall, JavaScript makes the To-Do List web app interactive, responsive, and efficient, providing users with a seamless task management experience.
